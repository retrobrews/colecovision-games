With the changes made in the last few days, the game Io has become quite playable, so I decided to post the current development version, 0.10, here.

Here's a quick description of some important screen elements:
* "Sulphur in HQ": Shows the current amount of sulphur in the HQ (you loose when this reaches 0, and the sulphur storage capacity of the HQ
* "Workers": Shows the number of free workers (i.e. those not currently working on a construction site) and the total number of workers
* "HQ Level": Current HQ level. Higher levels increase the amount of workers and the sulphur consumption. You win the level by increasing this to 10.
* "Toolbar": Shows the currently selected tool (same as cursor) and a clickable list of tools (you can also change the tool by using the right fire button). At certain moments,such as after changing the tool, the toolbar is briefly replaced by a display of the name of the new toll.
* "Sulphur Source": Provides sulphur. The suplhur can be supplied to other storage locations, such as your HQ, when there is a road or rail connection.
* "Rock": Construction is not possible here.
* "Sulphur vent": Can be turned into a Sulphur Source by building a depot on top of it.
* "Debug Info": Just some data to help me during development. Does not affect gameplay

The main aspect of the game is to supply enough sulphur to your HQ by building a transportation network consisting of sulphur sources, depots, roads and rail.
At the start of the game, you should first connect your sulphur source to the HQ. Rail connections have higher capacity than roads, but need more time to construct. 
One unupgraded sulphur source supplies enough sulphur for one idle worker. Busy workers need twice as much.
