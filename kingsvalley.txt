It takes more than a mummy's curse to scare away Vick the adventurer!

Vick, the notorious English adventurer from Manchester, has gone to the Valley of the Pharaohs in search of the Mystery Jewels, 
which supposedly hold the secret of eternal life in the Kingdom of the Sun God. These jewels were locked away in secret pyramids 
guarded by cursed mummies. Use knives and pickaxes left behind by the ancient egyptian builders to collect the jewels and uncover 
passageways to the other pyramids. Will Vick fall victim to the dreaded curse of the mummy?
