Turbo (2010 Daniel Bienvenu) [Standard Controller Hack]

Turbo is a racing game released in 1981 by Sega. It was one of the most popular arcade games of 1981. 
The game was manufactured three formats: standard upright, cabaret/mini, and a seated environmental/cockpit.

Turbo requires the player to navigate a road race through different urban and rural locations, through 
differing weather conditions, and during changing times of day. The cars in the game resemble Formula 1 
race cars. In order to proceed, the player must pass and stay ahead of at least 30 competing cars before 
time expires. Some opponents drive predictably, while others swerve across the road suddenly.

In the first round, the player has unlimited lives; collisions with other vehicles will return the 
player's car to the starting line. In subsequent rounds, the player is limited to three lives, and 
awarded an additional life (up to a total of four) for each completed round. In addition to competing 
racers, an ambulance occasionally comes along from behind and overtakes the player - they must be avoided, 
as contact with them will cause the player to lose a life; the game will be over when all player lives are gone.
