Santa Must Save Christmas (2011 Michel Louvet)

9 days before Christmas. Santa deliver gift from his factory to the warehouse. But the evil Grinch have done a bad trick. 
All the gifts are lost in North Pole.
Now, you're mission is to get back all gift before Christmas Night ! Or eventually make an high score :) :)

This free game is for you Coleco Lovers, this "stampede clone" is my little contribution for Christmas, hope you'll appreciate it !! 
The sprites GFX are made by Crapahute !! Have fun !
