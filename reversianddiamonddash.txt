Reversi - Diamond Dash (2004 Daniel Bienvenu)

For several years, I tried to code the artificial intelligence of this game. 
At first it took about an hour per game at the highest difficulty level, then I was able to optimize the waiting time with assembly language. 
Tired of coding it, *I put* it on the ice until AtariAge asked to publish this game. For the occasion, I added the bonus game Diamond Dash.

Reversi 
Based on the classic board game where your objective is to capture the most pieces on the game board by flipping discs to your color. 
A disc, or an unbroken line of discs of the same color, is captured when it becomes flanked on opposite ends by two opposing pieces, 
one of which must be the disc that was just placed on the board. The player with the most discs at the end of the game is the winner! 
A tie can also result if both players have the same number of discs at the end. Now you can enjoy this masterpiece of strategic combat on 
your ColecoVision game console, thanks to ColecoVision programmer Daniel Bienvenue.

Diamond Dash
Dig through five mountains with a limited supply of dynamite, collecting all the diamonds as fast as you can! Do you have the 
skill to make it through all five mountains?
