Text Adventure (2015 Chris Derrig)

Unlike most text adventure games, 2010 is not controlled by typing in verb-noun commands. 
Instead the player uses the keyboard's six function keys (or smart keys as they are called on the Adam) to interact with the world. 
The commands that are shown are context sensitive and depend on the situation, where the player is and what previous actions have been made. 
Moving around is done by the directional key, and by pressing return the examine menu appears. 
It consists of four options; to examine the area, its equipment, its items and any pods that are present. 
By pressing the home key the player is able to camp. 

Camping allows the player to organize items (picking up, dropping, examining them etc.), 
check life support (status of food, water, rest, power and medical supplies), 
recharging power and supplies, performing medical treatment and removing the spacesuit. 

By successfully performing various activities the player earns points. 
The current score is shown every time the player ends camping.
