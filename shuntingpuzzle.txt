Shunting Puzzle (2007 Philip Klause Krause)

This is a simple shunting puzzle for the ColecoVision. 
It has two levels corresponding to the classic Inglenook and Timesaver shunting puzzles.
Move the joystick forward / backward to move the engine.

The first fire button activates and deactivates decoupling mode. 
In decoupling mode a blue decoupling cursor appears and marks the decoupling position. 
It can be moved along the train by moving the joystick left/right. 
The second fire button decouples (and leaves decoupling mode).

Switches can be operated using the numbers on the keypad. 
Current switch positions are signaled by the point indicators next to the switches.
