Circus Charlie (2011 Team Pixelboy)

Are you clown enough to brave all five circus acts?

Step right up! Step right up! See the amazing Charlie the Clown perform death-defying stunts
for your amusement! Jumping through fiery hoops on the back of a lion, evading wild monkeys on
a tightrope, walking on balloons, riding a horse across a field of suspended trampolines,
swinging from rope to rope high above the ground, there's no challenge crazy enough for
Charlie! Guide Charlie and help him reach the end of each stage, and rack up points along the
way! One wrong move and it's bye bye Charlie! Mess up too many times and Charlie will get fired!
