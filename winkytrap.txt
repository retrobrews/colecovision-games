Winky Trap (1997 Jean-Francois Dupuis) [Mouse Trap Hack]

Jeans first work on ColecoVision was a hacked version on Mouse trap he called Winky Trap.
Mouse Trap is a 1981 arcade maze game developed by Exidy. The game design is similar to Pac-Man, replacing Pac-Man with a mouse, 
the dots with cheese, the ghosts with cats, and the power pills with bones. 
The unique element of Mouse Trap is that color-coded doors in the maze can be toggled by pressing a button of the same color.

The game was ported by Coleco as a ColecoVision launch title in 1982, then later to the Intellivision and Atari 2600.
