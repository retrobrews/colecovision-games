Victory (2010 Daniel Bienvenu) [Standard Controller Hack]

In Victory, use your Coleco Roller Controller to rotate your ship as the space around you scrolls by, smack your fire button to take out anything that moves and snag a power-up or two along the way to aid in your quest. Similar in style to Asteroids, but with a moving background.
Victory is a video game published in 1983 on ColecoVision by Coleco Industries, Inc.. It's an action game, set in a shooter and licensed title themes.
