Battleship (2003 Mathieu Proulx) [DEMO]

Battleship is a guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which the players' fleets of ships (including battleships) are marked.
The locations of the fleet are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game 
is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
Battleship is known worldwide as a pencil and paper game which dates from World War I. 
It was published by various companies as a pad-and-pencil game in the 1930s, and was released as a plastic board game
