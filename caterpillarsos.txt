Caterpillar S.O.S.
by Collectorvision Games | 2011

Move Buldozer up, down, right or left. Push dirt piles from right or left to get profit.
Send oil sample by pushing side button. Go to "CAT DLR" for repairs.
Buldozer cannot cross dirt plies vertically. Breakdown will occur, if repair & SOS warnings are ignored.
