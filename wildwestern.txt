Wild Western! (200X Opcode) [DEMO]


Help law and order prevail on the electronic frontier!
Outlaws are out to ambush the train. You're the Sheriff who can stop them with your faithful horse. 
You can't shoot over the train, but you can fail back and get the bandints from behind. 

I was thinking about some Arcade Games that I loved playing as a kid. Wild Western was one of them. 
The arcade game had 2 joysticks one for movement and one for shooting, the one shooting had a fire button on top. 
This always seemed like a major hurdle for porting the game. 

I was thinking today, what if the keypad aimed and fired the gun in the different directions. 
An overlay could be made for the keypad. My idea is move your cowboy with the joystick and use the keypad for shooting in the following directions.

1 = diagonally up and to the left 
2 = straight up
3 = diagonally up and to the right
4 = straight left
5 = not used for shooting
6 = straight to the right
7 = diagonally down and to the left
8 = straight down
9 = diagonally down and to the right
