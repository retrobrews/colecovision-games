Steamroller (2001 Retrotopia)

Welcome to the strange land of Steamroller! Play against the computer or against another player head-to-head. 
Either way, you must use your Steamroller to repair the ever-deteriorating convoluted roadway: 
Potholes grow into Manholes, and if one of those smiling Beachballs falls into a Manhole, it bounces out a killer Beachbomb! 
So fix Potholes, pop Beachballs and watch out for that other Steamroller!

Speed around road maze crushing beachballs and picking up prizes!
Fix potholes before beachballs fall in and become bombs!
In one-player game, compete against a deadly computer-controlled steamroller that will destroy you on contact - except in the few seconds at the end of each round when you can turn around and crush IT.
In two-player game, go head-to-head against your opponent. Race to pick up prizes first; bump your opponent into oncoming bombs!
Multiple levels and road mazes with ever-increasing speeds.
