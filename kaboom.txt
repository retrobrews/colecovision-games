Kaboom!
by Team Pixelboy | 2017

Our charming Mad Bomber really doesn't mean any harm. It's just that he loves nothing better than to drop his bombs and watch them explode! 
Only you can stop him! As he tosses his bombs, you race to douse their fuses with your buckets of water. 
The more bombs that splash in your buckets, the more points you score. 
But, the more points you score, the faster the bombs drop! Miss a bomb, and you'll learn how "Kaboom!" got its name. 
Here's a true test of stamina, reflexes and concentration - Activision's Kaboom! brought to your ColecoVision by N'APA'LM Software!

This game is part of the Team Pixelboy Budget Series.
