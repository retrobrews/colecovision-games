Cosmo Fighter 3 (2001 Marcel de Kogel) [Playable Demo]

As commander of the Cosmo Fighters, you have successfully defended the planet Xunor from an Alien Attack in Cosmo Fighter 2.
Unfortunately, you have failed to destroy the enemy fleet entirely. And now, after two years of peace in the galaxy, it's back and once again seeking destruction! 
Again, you'll have to face a dangerous fleet of enemy fighters before facing the final challenge...
