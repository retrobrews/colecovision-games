Nibbli "Son Of Nibbler" (Nibbli RC1.1)

Slinking through an unknown land, Nibbli finds himself in an iridescent world of constant change.
Gorging and gobbling, out-of-control Nibbli devours everything in sight. Still he must complete his task.
He must explore glowing new worlds where even greater challenge await.

As Nibbli, Nibbler's son, you must chart your course while moving at increasingly exhilarating speeds.
Beware - what looks like an easy route may be the path to your destruction.
