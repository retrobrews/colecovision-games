War
by Gerry Brophy | 2014

Command your Tank in a death battle until all your enemies tanks are destroyed. 
Destroy buildings, rocks, trees and barbed wire to flush out the enemy tanks from their cover and destroy them.
Next take to the skies and battle the enemy plane to plane in a show down for air superiority. 
But watch out for birds as they will cause your plane to crash.
2 Player action for your Colecovision or Adam home computer.
