Maze Maniac (2005 Charles-Mathieu Boyer)

Maze Maniac is a homebrew game for the old colecovision system. The objective is pretty simple : get as fast as you can through each maze. 
But I never said it was easy ! The difficulty increase with each maze. Sometimes, There are multiple exits so you have to decide which one might be faster. 
There are also flames that can block you a passage and pits that appears to slow you down. You can also bring a friend to play with! 
In all, there are seven modes of play. There is even an on-line ranking ! 
When you complete a mode, you are given a code to be classed among the best !

Maze Maniac was made possible using a lot of programs, utilities, code, documentation and help around the web.
Most of these are from guys like Daniel Bienvenu, Marcel de Kogel, Neal Danner, Marat Fayzullin and John Dondzila. 
Without them (and many others I might forget !), this game would have never existed.
