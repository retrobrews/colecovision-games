Quest For The Golden Chalice (2012 Team Pixelboy)

Dragons and castles and bats... Oh my!
The cowardly Prince of Larosia will need to face his deepest fears, as his kingdom has 
been overrun by a group of hungry dragons! Even worse, the evil mastermind behind this
attack is none other than Mardok the wizard, who the Prince had banished a year before!
The townspeople - including the royal guards - have all fled the kingdom, leaving the 
Prince alone to fend for himself, and even worse, Mardok has stolen the Golden Chalice,
the greatest treasure of Larosia! It now falls to the Prince to restore the people's 
confidence in his royalty, and there's only one way to do it: He must return the Golden
Chalice to the Yellow Castle!
