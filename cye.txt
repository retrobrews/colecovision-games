Cye 1.0 (2007 Philip Klaus Krause) [Playable Demo]

Cye is a clone of Kye, a Boulderdash-like game. It has 42 levels, 8 of them are two-player levels.
The demo version has 11 levels (including 7 two-player levels).

Some years ago, I wrote Cye, a puzzle game, which has some similaritites to Sobokan and Boulder Dash, and is essentially a port of Kye. 
Unlike Kye, Cye has a simultaneous, cooperative two-player mode. 
Since there were not many ColecoVision games of this type, and ColecoVision gamers tend to prefer arcade ports, I only made a limited run of 50 copies.
But the game sold out very quickly, so I made 20 copies of Cye 1.1, which has the same gamplay as Cye 1.0, but nearly all single-player levels are different.
A few years have passed. Cye 1.1 is sold out, the sdcc compiler and the other tools and libraries have improved since. 
This made it possible to make Cye 1.2 with more levels than the previous versions. 
Cye 1.2 includes all levels from Cye 1.1 and all except for 10 from Cye 1.0. 
It also contains 2 new two-player levels, for a total of 41 levels. I also made some changes to the graphics, and updated the demo.
