Spectank (2000 Daniel Bienvenu) [Unfinished]

In the city of the Spectanks, the heroic Wummel continues the crusade against evil and injustice. 
Scream around hairpin turns while avoiding enemy cruisers! 
Blast your way through to grab the energy stars and clear that city sector! 
This city is more dangerous than New York in the 1970's so grab your joystick and enter the this world.
