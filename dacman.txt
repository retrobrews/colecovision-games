DacMan (2000 Daniel Bienvenu)

The player controls a circular character which has a pie wedge shaped mouth to eat pellets through a maze, eating dots.
During summer 2000, I was thinking of doing another game based on my childhood memories. 
In the 80s, Canadian Tire did a games compilation for the Commodore VIC-20 computer and one of the games was a primitive PACMAN clone. 
My adaptation for the ColecoVision is nicer and faster but still the same game idea.
