Author's Comments: "January 2002, at university, a friend wanted to show me an online game he likes and dare me to make one for the ColecoVision.
Accepting the challenge, I've coded a first version in no time. However, studies first, I had to do my homework and forget about this game, 
until Mathieu Proulx asked to work on a videogame project with me so I suggested him to complete this one, and this is the result."
