Frostbite
by Team Pixelboy | 2017

Part survivor, part architect, part nuts, Frostbite Bailey eats raw fish for sustenance but really dines on danger! 
Help him construct igloos by jumping on floating blocks of ice! 
Each igloo must be completed before the weather gets too cold, but this is certainly no easy task, as Frostbite 
must not only contend with water currents that make the ice blocks move in different directions, he must also 
avoid wild animals like snow geese, king crabs, killer clams and a bear that follows him like a shadow on the shore! 
Stay one step ahead of all the hazards and survive to reach the highest possible score!

This game is part of the Team Pixelboy Budget Series.
