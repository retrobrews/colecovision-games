Death Race (2004 Dav) [Playable Demo]

In the game, one or two players control an on-screen car with a steering wheel and an acceleration pedal. 
The object is to run down "gremlins" who are fleeing the vehicle. 
As the player hits them, they scream or squeal and are replaced on-screen by tombstones. 
This increases the challenge of the game as the screen clutters up and the player has to avoid the tombstones.

The cabinet is black with white graphics of a muscle car racing through a cemetery with a vulture in a tree looking on. The marquee and monitor bezel are colored. A limited number had white sides with the artwork in black, instead of the reverse. It was in an upright standard racing style cabinet.

I cut the attract mode and second player out of my previous version. There's no sound yet since my sound card is not working at the moment.
It's not completely accurate to the Exidy original, I've added a hi score display and I don't remember the peds having any sort of ai but it felt like they needed it. Also the original was all B&W I colorized the car and IIRC it the playfield wrapped on all sides, not sure though.
I've tested it in mess only , haven't gotten around to trying it on the real thing.
