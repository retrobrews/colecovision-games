Breakout (1999 Daniel Bienvenu)
by Daniel Bienvenu
Breakout is an arcade game developed and published by Atari, Inc.
In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. 
When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. 
To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.
For use with a ColecoVision emulator.

Author's Comments: "In 1998, I had all the tools to make my first ColecoVision game from scratch. 
However, it took me months to have the courage to program and publish my first game. 
I've decided to make something pretty easy, based on my first coded games on Commodore computers when I was young. 
In the Commodore VIC-20 computer user's manual, there is a code for a bouncing round shape and it inspired me to make my first Breakout games back then. 
The ColecoVision version has me feeling nostalgic about my childhood."
