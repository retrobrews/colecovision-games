Frog Feast (2008 Robert)

Arcade - Catch'em!
Frog Feast is a tribute to the Mattel Intellivision game Frog Bog, and play is nearly identical. 
The game is played by either a single player against the CPU or a second player. 
Each version of Frog Feast is graphically identical, but limitations in storage media have led to alteration or removal of some aspects, including music and sound.

Each player controls a frog in a lily pond. Flies wander around overhead, and you jump up and try to eat them. Each fly is worth two points. 
Two lily pads are the platforms. If you land in the water, your frog will swim back to a pad. Each round lasts three minutes, and as the 
game goes on, day turns into night. Finally, both frogs jump offscreen, and a firefly drags a "The End" sign to the middle of the screen.
If you leave a frog alone for 15 seconds, the computer will control it. This leads to an Attract Mode, with the computer playing itself. 
No two games are identical; the frogs and flies are all controlled by some of the best AI.
