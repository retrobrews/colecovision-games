Diamond Dash (2004 Daniel Bienvenu)

Dig five mountains with dynamites as fast as you can in this incredible 4k game where you can’t die but can be stuck.

Author's Comments: "For several years, I tried to code the artificial intelligence of this game. 
At first it took about an hour per game at the highest difficulty level, then I was able to optimize the waiting time with assembly language. 
Tired of coding it, *I put* it on the ice until AtariAge asked to publish this game. For the occasion, I added the bonus game Diamond Dash."
