You are a young Texan cowboy called Patsie, living a peaceful life at your parent's ranch. 
One day, you see the San Fermín festival on TV. 
After watching the 'encierro' (the famous Navarre running of the bulls) you immediately feel 
you must go to Spain and live that experience on your own. So, after working long hours and 
saving some money, you manage to buy an airplane ticket to Spain. Everything is ready to 
start your journey, following Hemingway's steps: Participate in eight consecutive bull 
runs without getting harmed. The 'fiesta' awaits you!!

This game is part of the Team Pixelboy Budget Series.
