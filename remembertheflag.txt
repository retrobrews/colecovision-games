Remember The Flag
by Team Pixelboy | 2017

Challenge a friend or the computer in this friendly tile-matching game. 
Players take turns flipping tiles, revealing flags from countries all over the world. 
Uncover two flags of the same country to score points. 
You can also score extra points via the tic-tac-toe system applied to flipped tiles, 
or by flipping special tiles that affect the game in various ways. 
For a different kind of challenge, you can also play in "solitaire" mode, which lets 
you try to uncover all the matching flags without going over a given limit of 
consecutive mismatches.

This game is part of the Team Pixelboy Budget Series.
