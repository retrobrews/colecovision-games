StarShip Defence Force (SDF RC1.1)
by Michel Louvet
2015/01/17

A new alien army has defeated the Ozma solar system. Now their ships are heading towards Earth. 
Alien forces are too strong. The only chance for mankind is to leave Earth and find another planet far away from the aliens.

Human survivors take place into starships to seek a new home.
You coordinate the actions of two gunners on a starship stayed behind to stop the enemies in a crossfire. 
Make sure they don't break your energy shield and destroy your spacecraft.

The future of mankind is in your hands!
