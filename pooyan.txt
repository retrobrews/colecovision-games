Rescue Pooyan From Fierce Wolves !

One day in a forest, a group of Wolves attacked the pig's house where Mother Pig (Mama) and her little Piggies (Pooyans) were living peacefully.
Mama fought against Wolves to protect Pooyans using arrows and meat.

For all her efforts, however, some Pooyans were kidnapped.
Hating the Wolves, Mama bravely goes to the Wolves' Lair to rescue Pooyans.

Is she able to beat wolves and take Pooyans back home ?
