I stumbled into the Intellivision programming forum and saw, http://atariage.com/forums/topic/275233-grail-of-the-gods-rogue-like-or-mini-rpg/. 
So I decided to take a look at his source code to add in graphics tileset for the level and the monster.  
I did the same for the PC version of Sword of Fargoal.  Eventually I 3D rendered a grail and then pixeled it to fit the Intellivision colorstack specification.  
Then I decided, why not make a Colecovision port of the game?  It exist on the Intellivision, Dark Basic, and TI99/4A.  The source code are available. 
 
The only thing I couldn't transfer over is the maze generation. It seems to requires number bigger than 8-bit in order to draw the maze.  
So, I got the idea from majestyx version to do a mappack. There's 29 different map, majority been taken from the level generated from the Intellivision version.  
There are some unique maps that have a treasure room guarded by a later level monster, a gauntlet which you fight through every enemy in the game, chess piece map, and etc.  
The item and monster are place randomly based on the rules provided.   
I added more adjectives to the weapon and armor in jest since they do break easily, just like Zelda:Breath of the Wild. 
I added animation and sound effects for the battle.  
I added easy mode to add 10 more HP, atk, and armor every level up. Easiest mode add 20 HP,atk,and armor.
