PV2000 (2012 Nicolas Campion)

PV2000 is only a game for fun: this a conversion of an unknown game available for Thomson, a French computer.
Nicolas programmed this game because synopsis game made him laugh: you guide a policeman round in order to give 
fines to cars and avoid others cars which try to run over him.
Moreover, when Nicolas played it, he discovered that the game programming was very simple.
So it took him only one week to port it, especially as he had not need to use sprites.
