Spunky's Super Car!
by Collectorvision Games | 2014

In the universe, there exists a car with really cool tail fins of awesome power. This car wants to party, and you've been chosen to come along for the ride.
Slide into the leather bucket seats of adventure, with Spunky's super car! You have to drive the super car through time and space.

It seems that the Colecovision is getting some more love from the indie development scene. 
Spunky’s Super Car is a smorgasboard of gaming rather than just one genre. 
In one level you are running over tombstones in a cemetary while in another you are driving under water and shooting mermaids and taking their treasures. 
Other levels prominently feature jumping and other play mechanics that you don’t often see in a game featuring a car as the main character.
