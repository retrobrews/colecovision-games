A little skiing game I created during my spare time.
Enjoy.

Controls: Left and Right

Modes :
- Downhill: Complete the track before the time runs out.
- Slalom: Pass flags to the right side (left for blue and red for right) and complete the track before the time runs out. Miss a flag cost 2 seconds of penalty.
- Survival: Skiing until you hit a pine tree or a rock.
