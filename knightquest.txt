Knight Quest (2013 Nicolas Campion) [WIP]

When you were child, your dream was to become a knight but your fate was to be a peasant like your parents. 
This goal has always seemed impossible to reach.
Now the only way to achieve your dream is to patricipate in a series of tests.
The winners of the contest can access this social position.
Survive the six events to become the knight you want to be!

Khight Quest is the prototyped version for the final version of the game: "So you want to be a Knight ?"
This game will be for sale complete in box through CollectorVision Games later in 2015.

So I want to be a Knight?  Sure!  Why not?  I received my package of all the new games from CollectorVision today and for some reason 
this was the game that really intrigued me the most so I sat down and played for a good three hours today.  
Let's get right into this with some bullet points....

PROS

6 Different Levels - The majority of them fun to play
I like the simplistic look and feel of the game.  Graphics were "clean" and looked good.
The levels offered a nice variety.  Each offered unique gameplay features.
Sound FX were good.
Packaging and presentation was fantastic!
CONS

One life - You Die - Game Over - Start again from the very beginning - Felt like this was the way they got around the game being short.
Some of the levels felt unfairly difficult.
Once you complete the 6 levels. That's it.  You're done.
OK, so let's take this from the top....  I open the box and I'm presented with the quality I've come to expect from CollectorVision...
