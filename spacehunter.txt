Space Hunter (2005 Guy Foster) [Playable Demo]

The year is 2083... Aliens are trying to invade earth. You are the only one brave enough to fight them.
Get in your space ship and shoot them into another dimension !!
But be careful, they will do anything to crash your ship and wipe you out of the galaxy.


Space Hunter was actually a game Guy programmed 24 years ago when he was 12 years old on a Timex Sinclair 1000.
When Guy started programming for the Colecovision, he was a bit nostalgic about the good old days of the Coleco and 8-bit CPUs.
So Guy decided to rename his Coleco game to "Space Hunter", as a tribute to his first ever game that he programmed.
