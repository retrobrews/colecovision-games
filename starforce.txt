Star Force (2011 Team Pixelboy)

The Final Star is our last hope against planet Gordess!
In the year 2010 of the Dimensional Almanac, a mysterious rogue planet appeared in the darkness
of the cosmos. It was named Gordess, and its war-driven inhabitants plundered the resources
of every planet they encountered, and left nothing but death in their wake. Fighting the
Gordess seemed impossible, and yet, against all odds, a brave soldier riding a space patroller
challenged the alien army. People called this space patroller the Final Star, and hoped it
would save them from impending doom. The Gordess has been commiting mass murder for the last
2000 years. As the pilot of Final Star, can you put a stop to it?
