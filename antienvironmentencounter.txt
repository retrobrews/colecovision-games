Anti-Environment Encounter (A.E.)
by Collectorvision Games | 2012

A.E.'s- deadly flying rays from an alien world. They hunt in swift "killing packs" and their sting is deadly.
You've got to blast them with your twin-barreled Stun Gun before they zap you.
Keep moving and don't be distracted by A.E.'s snaking maneuvers...
- Or you might not live to tell the tale. !
