Rise up to the challenge of your king!
The king of your kingdom is looking for a new knight to sire, and you're next in line
for the post! However, the king will only give your candidacy serious consideration if
you manage to bring back the coveted royal sword from the depths of his deadly dungeon!
Armed only with a crossbow, you must run, jump, climb and shoot your way through the
maze of dungeon rooms, picking up various items for bonus points and keys to open
locked doors along the way. Watch out for patrolling guards of all shapes and sizes,
most of which will shoot at you on sight! Find the sword, bring it back to your king,
and you will become the hero of your kingdom, and also its next royal knight!
