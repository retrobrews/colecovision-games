Smash (2004 Daniel Bienvenu)

Breakout type of game.. 
In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. 
When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. 
To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.


This project was done to give interest into ColecoVision programming. It was the example of a presentation about programming in C language for the ADAMCon. 
A variant named "Yank Bash" was done by one listener at the convention.
