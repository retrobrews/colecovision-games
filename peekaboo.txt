Peek-A-Boo (2010 Team Pixelboy)

Come play with Elmo in his play room!
Introducing the latest offering from the wizards at Dvik & Joyrex, a game designed
specifically for toddlers and pre-schoolers (ages 1 to 6)! Elmo of Sesame Street is
hiding in his play room, and he wants to play a game of peek-a-boo with you! This game
offers two play modes, one for toddlers (where Elmo pops up whenever the player presses
any direction on the joystick or any button on the controller) and another for
pre-schoolers (where the player is required to push the joystick in the direction
where Elmo appears, within a short time limit). Elmo actually speaks in this game!
Come and play with Elmo!
