Subroc Super Game
by Team Pixelboy | 2014

Fight for supremacy of the high seas!
As the pilot of the Subroc sea-to-air attack vehicle, you were hailed as a national hero after single-handidly 
repelling the enemy army which was trying to gain control of the commercial sea shipping lines. 
But this victory only served to strengthen the enemy's resolve, and now they are back with a vengeance! 
Luckily, you are now in command of the SubRoc Mark-II, which is fully submersible, making it a force to be 
reckoned with on the high seas.

Destroy enemy saucers, robotic boats and incoming missiles on the surface, then dive underwater to face 
enemy submarines and mines. Your government is counting on you!
