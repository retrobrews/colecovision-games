Maid Of The Mist (2007 Dale Wick)

In the Mist maid you are in a boat near niagara falls.
You must avoid at all costs the driftwood that comes against you from the waterfall.

You are the captain of the proud Maid of the Mist, taking tourists to view Niagra Falls. Sounds easy? 
Well, to keep from being fired you need to keep your ship in ship shape, by avoiding rocks and logs in your way. 
Hit one, and your ship will slow, and you will risk falling behind. Hit too many and you’ll sink. 
Watch for the dreaded whirlpools which are sure to sink you.
