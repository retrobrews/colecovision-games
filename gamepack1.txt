Game Pack 1 (2002 Daniel Bienvenu)

With the objective to improve my development kit, I've started to optimize my toolkit library to be able to program even more in the cartridge memory size. 
After weeks of converting routines into assembly language, I've done this compilation of games, most of them are adaptations of simple games in BASIC 
from an old book for the Oric computer.
