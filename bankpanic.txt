Bank Panic
2011
Team Pixelboy

This must be the most dangerous job in the west!
You've recently been recruited as the town's newest sheriff, but that shiny new badge of yours does nothing to scare away the crooks! 
The local bank is often the target of surprise bank robberies, and you've decided to take the bull by the horns and stand guard as the 
bank's self-appointed security officer, to shoot the robbers as soon as they show their ugly faces. 
But be careful! Shoot a regular customer, get shot by a robber, or allow bombs to go off and you'll be out of a job faster than you can say "skedaddle"!
