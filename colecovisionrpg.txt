ColecoVision RPG v023 (2006 Bruce Tomlin) [DEMO]

Back in 2005 began Bruce on a very big RPG project.
It promised fine but after 4 years of programming it had unfortunately no interest anymore.
The RPG game was never named.

And as Bruce said in 2009:
"And for those who are thinking the question, the chance of this ever making it to the Colecovision is pretty low.
It's not zero, since a lot of the engine code has already been written".

So whether the game will be resumed again is unknown, but perhaps publishers will embrace it.
