Sudoku v02 (2008 Team Pixelboy) [Playable Demo]

To solve a Sudoku puzzle, place a number into each cell so that each row, each column, and each small 3x3 box
within the larger puzzle will contain every number from 1 to 9. In other words, no number may appear more than
once in every row, column, or 3x3 box. The game is initialized with predefined numbers and the objective is to
complete the puzzle with the missing numbers that will lead to the correct solution. The game features three
levels of difficulty: Novice, Adept, and Master.
