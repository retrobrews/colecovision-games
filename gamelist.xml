          <desc>This must be the most dangerous job in the west! You've recently been recruited as the town's newest sheriff, but that shiny new badge of yours does nothing to scare away the crooks! The local bank is often the target of surprise bank robberies, and you've decided to take the bull by the horns and stand guard as the bank's self-appointed security officer, to shoot the robbers as soon as they show their ugly faces. But be careful! Shoot a regular customer, get shot by a robber, or allow bombs to go off and you'll be out of a job faster than you can say "skedaddle"!</desc>

          <desc>The objective of this game is to swap one gem with an adjacent gem to form a horizontal or vertical chain of three or more gems of the same color. Bonus points are given when chains of more than three identical gems are formed and when two chains are formed in one swap. Gems disappear when chains are formed and gems fall from the top to fill in gaps. Sometimes chain reactions, called cascades, are triggered, where chains are formed by the falling gems. Cascades are awarded with bonus points. There are two variations of the game to choose from.</desc>

The first mission was scrubbed after all contact was lost with the spaceship launched five years before. Upon arriving on Titan, the crew of the second mission found the wreckage of the lost spaceship, which had apparently been damaged by an unexpected dense rock belt upon entry into Titan's atmosphere. Important supply components were scattered all over the moon, and it's now the job of Astro Willy to gather these components which are vital to the mission. Guide Astro Willy through the perilous caverns of Titan, as he recovers the scattered components. But be quick about it! Astro Willy's oxygen reserves are very limited!</desc>

In this emergency situation, there's only one way you can carry out your contract: You must drive your car alongside each train, and use your M-16 rifle to break the train's windows, in order to let the hostages escape. However, not only must you contend with incoming traffic of trains and cars that block your line of fire, you must also watch out for hostile helicopters bent on stopping you dead in your tracks.

They want to use one of their classic franchises, but they're not sure which one to pick. After several hours of debate, it was decided that the main characters of these franchises would square off in a Flip Shot tournament, and the winner will see his game released on Coleco cartridges. Up to 8 human players can participate in this tournament by selecting their characters and then trying to pop their opponent's capsules by hitting the free-floating ball before the timer runs out. Each character has special abilities that can affect the ball in unexpected ways!</desc>
