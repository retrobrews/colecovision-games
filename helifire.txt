The player controls a submarine that shoots down helicopters.

You and your men managed to enter a secret base to steal two not friendly submarines.
You took control of them but while escaping the enemy’s lair the alarm was raised.
Now the whole hostile army is chasing you across the sea.
Will you survive?

2 players can play together on the same screen!
