Hi everyone. Been about a year since I've been on here. Sorry for the long absence -- had a couple deaths in the family, 
and between that and kids and work, I've been pretty busy.
I do need to get back to manufacturing my Adam SD Drive sooner or later -- but in the mean time, I thought I'd give game programming a try. 
For my first effort, I decided on Horse Racing, since the picture of it always looked SOOO exciting to me when I was a kid. Attached is demo.


Changelog:
Rev01:
What works:
You can move two of the horses left/right/up/down with the controllers.
You can dodge in and out of the other horses (collision detection works).
Oh, and I forgot to mention that if you press a button after race is done, it will start a new race. 
What doesn't work (yet):
No real strategy to the game.
No score is kept.
No computer AI on other two horses (they just move about randomly).

I tried to be as accurate as possible to Coleco's picture (I blew up a copy of the picture, overlaid a grid on it, and then translated it to the screen).
Some sacrifices had to be made due to the Colecovision's limitations. I did however add some other graphics (trees, people, cars, etc) to liven things up a bit more.
I've only ever tried this on an emulator, since I don't have the means to try it on the real hardware -- so there may be glitches with it that I'm not aware of.


Rev02:
Improvements:
- Faster scrolling routine -- over 2x speed improvement!!!
- Computer-controlled horse AI code implemented.
- Stamina system implemented. You now get penalized if you whip your horse too much.
- Side button now controls when you whip your horse (you don't use right any more).
- Curves implemented. You now get penalized the farther you are to the outside when on a curve.
- Graphical improvements to the starting gates.

Still to do (these are all pretty minor, I think):
- Implement scoring system.
- Implement 2-player game play.
- Implement betting system.

Overall, I think the game plays pretty well at this point, so give it a try!

Rev03:
This one has:
- Menu selection system (a preliminary take on it, at least)
- Selection for number of players
- Selection for which horse you want to be
- Selection for number of laps
- Selection for track conditions (changes graphics, but has no actual affect on gameplay so far)
- Selection for wager (non functional yet)
- Race number counter
- Race timer
Still to do:
- Keep track of winning horses
- Implement wager system
I plan on finishing up this, then try to add a mode (selectable by the user) to have it look like the other version Coleco showed. 
The more I think about it, it seems like it should be pretty do-able. It's really the same game, just with the x and y axis reversed, and different graphics. 
The core game engine should stay the same, I would think....

Rev04:
Pretty much everything is finished in this release (that I can think of, anyway).
- Keep track of times, and rank the winners.
- Implemented a simple wagering system. I kept it as simple as possible, since to me nobody wants to place bets against a computer. 
Was that ever any fun for anyone, even back in the early 1980s?
- Menus totally reworked.
- Computer AI substantially reworked and improved.
- Length of races now measured in furlongs.
- Stamina system implemented. You now get a set amount at the beginning of the race. This introduces a bit of strategy to the game. 
The old system wasn't doing it for me -- horse racing should involve some strategy, in my opinion.
What do you guys think? Did I miss anything? Feedback appreciated!
P.S. Unless you guys can think of anything, I think I'll work on converting this to the other (front) view from the Coleco flyer....

Rev05:
Just a couple of small changes to make the game a bit more challenging:
- You now lose the money you bet if you don't win the bet you made.
- You aren't allowed to bet more money than you have (essentially making it Game Over when you run out of money).

Rev06:
Some small updates:
- Found a small difference in where I was calculating the finish line depending on if the screen was scrolling or not scrolling when a horse crossed.
- Races that end in a tie should now be scored correctly.
- Now print a 'Game Over' message when a player runs out of money.
