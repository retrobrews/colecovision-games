Canadian Minigames (2008 Wick-Foster-Bienvenu)

Diamond Dash
You are the new super miner and your goal is to extract enough diamonds in
abandoned mines to keep your title of super miner. When you get enough
diamonds, a signal alerts you to go back quickly to the exit at the top right of
the screen. Each explosion generates cave-ins that can block the exit. 

Easter Bunny
Each year, the Easter Bunny (E.B. For short) is hiding decorated eggs for the
kids. Before this happens, E.B. needs to collect the eggs in his magical world.
This year, Mother Bird decided to teach E.B. a lesson. To save the day, help
E.B. avoid Mother Bird's attacks and collect all the eggs on the screen.

Space Hunter
In this game, you are a heroic space fighter who has unfortunately stumbled
into an unfriendly area of space. You are being attacked and need to defend
yourself quickly. The game starts off slowly, but don't be fooled. Using all of
your skills and wit you have to destroy the oncoming enemies. The waves of
enemies seem to come from all directions at a faster and faster pace. What
lies after the 13 waves of enemies? Only one way to find out!

Get Booty
The year is 1780 and adventure is afoot. You've just signed on to the pirate
ship "Mermaid's Choice" as a gunner. Your job when a ship comes near is to
use your precision gunning skills to disable the ship by hitting the base of
their masts. The tall ships that you encounter in the Carribean Sea are
generally of the two mast variety, and as you'd expect carry varying amounts
of coins and jewels. Hit the ship sooner, and haul in more booty.

The goal was to publish a minigames collection and a joystick test utility in a single cartridge."
