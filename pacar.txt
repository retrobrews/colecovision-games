Pacar (2010 Steve Begin) [Playable Demo]

Welcome to the Pacific Car Derby, or PACAR for short! Unlike other car battle
derbies that focus mainly on demolition, this race is all about outwitting your
opponents, as you must drive your car in a closed road maze and collect fuel
pellets to earn points! The derby organizers have hired kamikaze drivers who
patrol the road maze and crash into any contender's car without hesitation. 
It's now your turn to enter the road maze with your car! How long can you last?
