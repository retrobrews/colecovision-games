Max has got a cat named Kit. This cat is very special. Indeed, he can speak… and he does too much! He spends his time asking Max for food. His favourite meal? 
Fresh fish of course. Max knows that the cat would eat fish, but would not wet its feet. So, he has decided to go fishing, out of friendship, to feed his hungry companion.
Here you are, in the middle of the ocean on your frail craft, armed with your fishing rod and some bait fish. Will you bring enough food to satisfy your greedy Kit cat?
