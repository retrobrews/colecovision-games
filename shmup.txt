Shmup!
by Team Pixelboy | 2017

Once again, alien forces threaten the Earth. 
Now it's time for you to repel the attack and save the planet, by launching a surprise attack of your own into the alien trenches
where the boss ships are stationned while they get ready for the final invasion. You control a pair of space fighters that work 
in tandem. Collect enough fusion capsules left behind by defeated drones and your two ships will merge into a super-fighter! 
Can you destroy the bulk of the enemy forces before they launch their attack?

This game is part of the Team Pixelboy Budget Series.
