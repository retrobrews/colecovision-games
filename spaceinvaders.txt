Game Play
Move your base left or right to shoot the endless waves of aliens marching towards earth. 
There are four buildings shields that you can hide behind, but eventually they will be destroyed either by enemy missiles or by the enemies themselves. 
The aliens' descent quickens as you eliminate them. Shoot the flying saucer for extra points. 
See the "FURRER" trick for information on receiving 300pts every time you hit the saucer.

Requeriments:
==============
- In order to use this Space Invaders for ColecoVision demo, you will
need a good ColecoVision emulator. OpCode recommeds using Adamem or 
MESS. Others emulators can work too but OpCode hasn't certified them 
yet. It's known that some emulators aren't able to handle interrupts 
properly, so this demo won't work on every existing ColecoVision 
emulator.
- This demo isn't intended to be used in a real ColecoVision system. 
There are still several timing bugs and the real machine is very 
sensitive to them. OpCode would like to apologize to all game purists 
who don't like to play on emulators. A bug free demo will be released 
sortly.

Known Issues:
==============
- This demo doesn't have sound. It isn't a bug!
- This demo just allow you to play the first round. It will freeze 
every time any of the players manage to clear round one. It's not a 
bug!

How to play:
=============
- Press "#" on the primary controller to place credits (insert coin).
- Press "1" or "2" (1 or 2 players, respectively) on the primary 
controller to start playing.
- Enjoy!
