Ms. Space Fury (2001 Daniel Bienvenu)

During each round, you must destroy all alien ships and everytime you successfully complete this task, there is an intermission where 
the one-eyed alien creature will taunt you and vow to strike back.
During the attract mode and in between rounds, the player is taunted by the one-eyed alien using digitized speech. 
During the attract mode: "Is there no warrior mightier than I?" and "Does anyone dare challenge my imperial fleet?". 
During the game: "So, a creature for my amusement. Prepare for battle!", "So, you defeated my scouts. My cruisers will destroy you.", 
"You are starting to annoy me, creature. My destroyers will annihilate you.", "You survived! Warriors! Dispose of this annoyance at once."


Author Comments: "Digital Press has asked me to do a special ColecoVision game for their 10th anniversary and I've accepted. 
After a discussion with Sylvain de Chantal and Joe Santulli, we agreed on the game concept and started the project. 
Sylvain de Chantal worked on the graphics while I was working on the development tools, sounds and the game itself. It was a great success."
