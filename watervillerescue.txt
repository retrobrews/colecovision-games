Waterville Rescue (2009 Mike Brent)

The Waterville Gang was a funny and intelligent kid's show, and in part to pay homage to it while still creating my favorite kind of game, I created this. 
Dodger and Sharky rush to save Angel and Eloise from the Evil Sea Monster!
This is a two-player simultaneous shooter (requires Joysticks) with various phases but just one very long and unforgiving level, and an intense boss 
battle that I've won honestly only once (and that to prove it could be done). :)
