Dear GHOSTBLASTER,
Our home is haunted by ghosts who make us sick. All of this started the night after we decorated our home with magical gems we
bought off of the internet for a special 10th anniversary party.
We did try to remove the gems ourselves in hopes that the ghosts would just go away, but these ghosts don’t want to leave. They
keep replacing the gems, and they’ve modified our home to trick us...you will see. Please help!
Sincerely,
C.C.J.V.Q.

EXIT DOORS
Once you have collected all of the gems and keys, find the unlocked exit door and escape the house. If the exit door remains locked,
you either failed to find all of the keys, or it is a trick exit door.


To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the CCJVQ club, the one and only ghostblaster has to eliminate all of the ghosts and collect gems 
in this amazing game for the ColecoVision game system.
