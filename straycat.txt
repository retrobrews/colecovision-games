Stray Cat
by Team Pixelboy | 2017

I'm Flash, the fastest Spanish cat in the city. 
I've spent the day wandering around with my friends, looking for some food and having fun... 
but I've suddenly remembered I have a date with Iris, the cutest kitty of the downtown area!! 
I'm already late and I have a long way to go, so I decided to race across the city rooftops 
to get to Iris' penthouse faster... But the rooftops are definately not safe, with obstacles 
around every corner! Iris is certainly worth the risk! I'll show you why they call me Flash!!

This game is part of the Team Pixelboy Budget Series.
