You are a young adventurer who seeks celebrity and richness.
The king of Deimos, capital of the southern coast of the Iron Weapons, offers a game for the amusement of his fellow citizens:
"The Labyrinth Of the Golden Suffering".

The game is quite simple.
Each participant is imprisoned in a labyrinth with only one exit door. Once inside, the door is magically locked.
In order to exit, you have to find the magic key hidden somewhere in the maze.

All along your way, you will find gold coins that you are authorized to keep with you.
Unfortunately, if you wish to enjoy your wealth one day, you will also have to fight numerous monsters to finally escape this frightening place.
