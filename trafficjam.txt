Traffic Jam
by Team Pixelboy | 2017

You're Sandy Olson, a young and beautiful traffic policewoman in charge of helping hundreds of 
drivers face the unavoidable traffic jam caused by summer roadworks. One of those drivers is 
Danny Zucku, an executive who works for a very important company. He has been your friend 
for some time, but now you feel you want to be something more than only his friend. 
So you make an extra effort to help him get to his job on time, by moving the cars and trucks 
around the area to clear a path for Danny's sportscar. As the days pass, the traffic jams get 
worse, and helping Danny becomes quite a challenging puzzle for you. If Danny cannot escape 
the morning traffic, he may get fired!

This game is part of the Team Pixelboy Budget Series.
