Yie-Ar Kung Fu (2005 Opcode)


This Yie Ar Kung-Fu game contains two different versions of the game.
Opcode Games and Konami put the fight back into your ColecoVision game system with Yie Ar Kung-Fu. 
In this spin-off of the exciting and innovative arcade game, you'll battle your way to the top of 
a mysterious palace filled with the world's most dangerous warriors. Can you withstand the might 
of the Chop Suey Triad Gang and save China from the diabolical Willy Wu? Whatever happens, you'll 
agree that your ColecoVision has never seen a fight this furious!
