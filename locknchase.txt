Lock 'n' Chase

Your thief's robbing a local bank.

Police are in hot pursuit! Make tracks down the vault corridors.
Swipe gold coins and other treasures as you go! Keep one step ahead of the law. !
Lock doors and throw cops off your trail! Collide with a cop...he's "caught". !

Keep on the run. !
