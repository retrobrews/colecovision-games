War is raging in the solar system of Ozma.
Alien armies invaded the area spreading death and destruction among the Human populations living on the 4 inhabited planets of this star.
You are the captain of the Star End, a space ship sent to stop the enemies.

Prepare for battle as the fight is going to be harsh. !
The whole mankind is threatened if this outpost falls. !

As it will be a long mission for sure, docking ships will meet you along your journey to replenish your energy.
