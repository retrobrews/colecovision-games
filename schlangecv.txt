Schlange CV 1.0 (2006 Philip Klaus Krause) [Playable Demo]


Overview
This is a port of the popular game Schlange/snake/nibbles to the Colecovision. 
There are four snakes, controlled using the Colecovision controllers (two humans can play simultanously) or artifical intelligence which try to 
avoid running into walls and eating stuff that keeps turning up on the field.

Levels
There are 45 different levels; during a game you play trough 23 randomly selected levels ordered with increasing difficulty.

Artifical intelligence
There are two different AI variants in the game.
The first is a quite simple AI (AI S) which is strong in early levels, but will have difficulties with the increasing number of obstacles in higher levels.
Then there is an advanced AI (AI <search depth>) searching for optimal paths. The search depth can be configured.

Music
At the beginning of each level music is randomly selected from 12 different melodies.

Game rules
A snake dies when it runs into another snake or the wall. When there are no snakes left the game is lost.

The snake that wins most levels will win the game. A level is won if a snake reaches the winning lengths. Snake length increases when the snake eats a bonus. 
There is a special bonus, which will halt all snakes except the one that ate it for a short time.
