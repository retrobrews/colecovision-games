Zippy Race
by Collectorvision Games | 2009

Zippy Race is a 1 Player Game

You Drive down to L.A. freeway, through the Vegas desert, over the Texas roadways, in and out of the Midwest backwoods.
And around the treacherous curves of the industrial megalopolis of the East Cost Obstracles.
That include cars, trees, puddles, rivers, bends in the road, rocks, trucks that drop barrels and even cactus.
