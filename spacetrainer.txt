Space Trainer (2005 Daniel Bienvenu)

Space Trainer first saw the light in 2005 at the MiniGame Competition. 
This is a hidden game in the Deflektor Collection. 
To activate it, you had to choose Paddle Test in the game, and press on the second joystick twice to the left. 
A real space action game for two players. 
Space Trainer reminds a Space War, but there's no need to shoot. 
Direct the ship to a moving bubble and wins who is faster.
