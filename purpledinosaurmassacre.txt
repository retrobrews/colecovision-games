Purple Dinosaur Massacre (1996 John Dondzilla)

Purple Dinosaur Massacre was Dondzila's first ColecoVision project.
This is more or less a 2 player playable demo.
Dondzila wasn't too crazy about how it looked and decided not to continue.

The main objective with this game was to get some sprite programming experience.

This will work on the emulator, however there is some keystroke.
You have to use to seperate the Player 1 and 2 controller input so both sights won't work off the player 1 controls.

The object of the game is to shoot as many Purple Dinos as possible before running out of ammo.
Shoot the POW for extra ammo.
The skill level increases every 10 dinos that you hit.
There's no sound in the game- not that Dondzila can't do sound programming, he just didn't feel like continuing this game.

So the game was never finished and have either no end.
