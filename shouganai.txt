Shouganai
by Team Pixelboy | 2017

As the pilot of the lone space freighter Asa Dashi, you were taken prisoner by the Funya Chin empire and arbitrarily 
sentenced to face the challenge of the Shouganai, a deadly game where you must pilot of caterpillar-like vehicle 
around an arena and grab diamonds. Avoid the patrolling alien drones at all cost, and also avoid land mines as you 
maneuver your vehicle along the walls of the arena and extend its "tail" to grab the diamonds. 
Grab all the diamonds in an arena and you then move on to the next (more challenging) arena. 
Upgrade your vehicle by grabbing special icons, but be careful, as some icons cause negative effects! 
If you survive all 24 arenas of the Shouganai, the Funya Chin empire may give you back your freedom... Maybe...

This game is part of the Team Pixelboy Budget Series.
