Star Ocean (2015 Chris Derrig)

This is a short RPG game I made for my best friend.
And Star Ocean, a Dragon Quest like game where you explore the world and encounter monsters. 
The few characters have different dialog depending on what quest you are on.  
So they would give you clues on how to beat this game.  
It's fairly short and maybe takes an hour to complete with animated ending.
