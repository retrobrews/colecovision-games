Reversi (2003 Daniel Bienvenu)

Reversi is based on the classic board game where your objective is to capture the most pieces on the game board by flipping discs to your color. 
A disc, or an unbroken line of discs of the same color, is captured when it becomes flanked on opposite ends by two opposing pieces, 
one of which must be the disc that was just placed on the board. The player with the most discs at the end of the game is the winner! 
A tie can also result if both players have the same number of discs at the end. Now you can enjoy this masterpiece of strategic combat on 
your ColecoVision game console, thanks to ColecoVision programmer Daniel Bienvenue.
